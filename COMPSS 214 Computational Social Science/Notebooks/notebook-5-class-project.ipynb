    "> In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation1,2,3,4. The enforcement of these policies has, however, led to technology companies being regularly accused of political bias5,6,7. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by people identifying with different political groups8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even by unbiased policies. We first analysed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the US 2020 presidential election. Although users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were indeed substantially more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites—even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople—and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots. We find similar associations between stated or inferred conservatism and low-quality news sharing (on the basis of both expert and politically balanced layperson ratings) in 7 other datasets of sharing from Twitter, Facebook and survey experiments, spanning 2016 to 2023 and including data from 16 different countries. Thus, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Political imbalance in enforcement need not imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies."

    "> In 2021, Twitter undertook a highly unusual intervention designed to counteract the spread of misinformation during a critical political event. Under normal circumstances, the effects of social media algorithms on information spread are very difficult to detect. This intervention was unusual because the number of deplatformed users was large, they belonged to a specific group, and the timing was made publicly known. A team of social media researchers examined the effects of this intervention, and published their findings in the world's most prestigous scientific journal.\n",

Were multiple alternatives examined? Can you iagine an alternative, more stringent approach to classification? How might the current classification approach have influenced the results?\n",
    "4. **Question 4: Primary Outcome = Daily count of Tweets and Retweets** The primary outcome variable in this study is a daily count of Tweets and Retweets of misinformation. Do you think this outcome variable is natural and useful? Can you iagine an alternative, more informative quantitity to measure and model?\n",
    "5. **Question 5: Synchronous Exit of Right-Wing Users** One potential confound in this study is that it is possible that many users who were not themselves deplatformed, but were behaviorally aligned with deplatformed accounts (e.g. Qanon users), left Twitter voluntarily in favor of emerging right-wing platforms. How do the researchers account for this possibility? How might this parallel exit have influence the findings here? Can you think of alternative ways to account for this confound?\n",
